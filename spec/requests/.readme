Request specs provide a thin wrapper around Rails' integration tests, and are
designed to drive behavior through the full stack, including routing
(provided by Rails) and without stubbing (that's up to you).

Request specs are marked by :type => :request or if you have set
config.infer_spec_type_from_file_location! by placing them in spec/requests.

With request specs, you can:

specify a single request
specify multiple requests across multiple controllers
specify multiple requests across multiple sessions
